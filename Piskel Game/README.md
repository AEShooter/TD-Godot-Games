A 2d platformer demo with pixel art and animations.
Use this demo to learn how Godot handles spritesheets.

All art made by [@TutorialDoctor](https://twitter.com/TutorialDoctor) with [@piskelapp](https://twitter.com/piskelapp).

Check out my [Piskel Art](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Piskel-Art) repo for more characters.

A full game with objective and all is in the works.
